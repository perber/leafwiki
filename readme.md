# 🌿 LeafWiki

**A lightweight, tree-based Markdown wiki – no database, just a single Go binary.**

LeafWiki is designed for teams and individuals who want a clean, fast, and self-hosted knowledge base — with full control over structure, content, and deployment.

## 📦 Status

- **Windows (x86_64)**
- **Raspberry Pi (tested with 64-bit OS)**

## 💭 Why Another Wiki?

After trying out tools like Wiki.js, Confluence, and DokuWiki, I wanted something simpler: no database, easy to host, Markdown-based, and truly Git-friendly.

- Why use a database just to store Markdown?
- Why should setup be a weekend project?
- Why can't a wiki just be file-based and fast?

**LeafWiki** was born out of that frustration — and the desire to have:

- 🧾 Clean Markdown files, organized in folders
- 🧠 A real tree structure, not a flat list
- ⚙️ A single binary with no external dependencies
- 🛠️ Something teams can actually self-host without DevOps pain

It’s not trying to be everything — just a solid, minimal wiki for people who want **clarity over complexity.**

## 🛠️ Installation (Production)

```
# Download the latest release from GitHub
chmod +x leafwiki
./leafwiki --jwt-secret=yoursecret
```

Default port is `8080`, and the default data directory is `./data`.
You can change the data directory with the `--data-dir` flag.

> ✅ Native ARM64 builds are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/perber/leafwiki/releases) section.

### Default admin user

The first time you run LeafWiki, it will create an admin user with the default password `admin`.

You can change this password later in the admin settings or by using the CLI:

```bash
./leafwiki --admin-password=newpassword --jwt-secret=yoursecret
```

> Note: `--admin-password` (or the `LEAFWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var) is only used on first startup, when no admin user exists yet.


### Reset Admin Password
If you need to reset the admin password, you can do so by running:

```bash
./leafwiki reset-admin-password
```

### ⚙️ CLI Flags

| Flag               | Description                                                 | Default       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `--jwt-secret`     | Secret used for signing JWTs (required)                     | –             |
| `--port`           | Port the server listens on                                  | `8080`        |
| `--data-dir`       | Directory where data is stored                              | `./data`      |
| `--admin-password` | Initial admin password (used only if no admin exists)       | `admin`       |
| `--public-access`  | Allow public access to the wiki (no auth required)          | `false`       |
   

### 🌱 Environment Variables

Instead of CLI flags, you can also configure LeafWiki using environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                                                  | Default    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `LEAFWIKI_PORT`          | Port the server listens on                                   | `8080`     |
| `LEAFWIKI_DATA_DIR`      | Path to the data storage directory                           | `./data`   |
| `LEAFWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`| Initial admin password *(used only if no admin exists yet)*  | `admin`    |
| `LEAFWIKI_JWT_SECRET`    | Secret used to sign JWT tokens *(required)*                  | –          |
| `LEAFWIKI_PUBLIC_ACCESS` | Allow public access to the wiki (no auth required)           | `false`    |

These environment variables override the default values and are especially useful in containerized or production environments.
