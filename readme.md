## üì¶ Status

> **Feature complete ‚Äì evolving carefully** 
> LeafWiki has reached functional completeness for its original vision and is already powering real documentation workflows.  
> Development now focuses on steady refinement rather than rapid feature growth.
>
> The current focus is on: 
> - Stability and reliability 
> - Usability improvements
> - Testing and CI improvements 
> 
> In the long term, additional features like versioning, improved diagram support (e.g. Mermaid), ‚Ä¶ are planned ‚Äî  
> but they‚Äôll be introduced gradually, with stability taking priority.  
> 
> Want to try it and help shape it? You‚Äôre more than welcome.

LeafWiki now builds and runs natively on:
- **Linux (x86_64 and ARM64)**
- **Windows (x86_64)**
- **Raspberry Pi (tested with 64-bit OS)**

## üí≠ Why Another Wiki?

After trying out tools like Wiki.js, Confluence, and DokuWiki, I wanted something simpler: no database, easy to host, Markdown-based, and truly Git-friendly.

- Why use a database just to store Markdown?
- Why should setup be a weekend project?
- Why can't a wiki just be file-based and fast?

**LeafWiki** was born out of that frustration ‚Äî and the desire to have:

- üßæ Clean Markdown files, organized in folders
- üß† A real tree structure, not a flat list
- ‚öôÔ∏è A single binary with no external dependencies
- üõ†Ô∏è Something teams can actually self-host without DevOps pain

It‚Äôs not trying to be everything ‚Äî just a solid, minimal wiki for people who want **clarity over complexity.**

## üí° LeafWiki vs. Markdown Readers

LeafWiki is often compared to simple Markdown viewers or file browsers - but it‚Äôs built for a very different purpose.

|                 | Markdown Reader             | LeafWiki                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Read static `.md` files     | Create and manage a structured wiki                              |
| **Data source** | Reads directly from disk    | Uses Markdown files as storage, but manages structure internally |
| **Structure**   | Flat folder view            | True tree of folders and pages                                   |
| **Editing**     | External text editor        | Built-in Markdown editor with live preview                       |
| **Uploads**     | Not supported               | Per-page assets (images, files)                                  |
| **Search**      | File names only             | Indexed full-text search (titles + content)                      |
| **Hosting**     | Static / local              | Self-hosted Go web app                                           |
| **Access**      | No authentication           | Role-based access (admin / editor)                               |

> LeafWiki doesn‚Äôt just *read* Markdown files ‚Äî it **organizes, edits, and serves** them.  
> It‚Äôs not a viewer, but a small wiki engine that happens to store everything as Markdown.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Production)

### Quick install
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perber/leafwiki/feat/add-quick-install/install.sh -o install.sh && sudo chmod +x ./install.sh && sudo ./install.sh --archi amd64
```

This command performs a quick installation of LeafWiki on the target machine. The installer script accepts the `--archi` flag to specify the target architecture (e.g. `amd64`, `arm64`).

---
### Manual installation

```
# Download the latest release from GitHub
chmod +x leafwiki
./leafwiki --jwt-secret=yoursecret
```

Default port is `8080`, and the default data directory is `./data`.
You can change the data directory with the `--data-dir` flag.

> ‚úÖ Native ARM64 builds are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/perber/leafwiki/releases) section.

### Default admin user

The first time you run LeafWiki, it will create an admin user with the default password `admin`.

You can change this password later in the admin settings or by using the CLI:

```bash
./leafwiki --admin-password=newpassword --jwt-secret=yoursecret
```

> Note: `--admin-password` (or the `LEAFWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var) is only used on first startup, when no admin user exists yet.


### Reset Admin Password
If you need to reset the admin password, you can do so by running:

```bash
./leafwiki reset-admin-password
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Flags

| Flag               | Description                                                 | Default       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `--jwt-secret`     | Secret used for signing JWTs (required)                     | ‚Äì             |
| `--host`           | Host/IP address the server binds to                         | `0.0.0.0`     |
| `--port`           | Port the server listens on                                  | `8080`        |
| `--data-dir`       | Directory where data is stored                              | `./data`      |
| `--admin-password` | Initial admin password (used only if no admin exists)       | `admin`       |
| `--public-access`  | Allow public access to the wiki (no auth required)          | `false`       |
   

### üå± Environment Variables

Instead of CLI flags, you can also configure LeafWiki using environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                                                  | Default    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `LEAFWIKI_HOST`          | Host/IP address the server binds to                          | `0.0.0.0`  |
| `LEAFWIKI_PORT`          | Port the server listens on                                   | `8080`     |
| `LEAFWIKI_DATA_DIR`      | Path to the data storage directory                           | `./data`   |
| `LEAFWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`| Initial admin password *(used only if no admin exists yet)*  | `admin`    |
| `LEAFWIKI_JWT_SECRET`    | Secret used to sign JWT tokens *(required)*                  | ‚Äì          |
| `LEAFWIKI_PUBLIC_ACCESS` | Allow public access to the wiki (no auth required)           | `false`    |

These environment variables override the default values and are especially useful in containerized or production environments.

Binding to localhost behind a reverse proxy
-------------------------------------------

If you run a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) in front of LeafWiki, you may want the Go server to only listen on the loopback interface. You can do that with the `--host` flag or the `LEAFWIKI_HOST` env var:

```bash
# bind to localhost only
LEAFWIKI_HOST=127.0.0.1 ./leafwiki --jwt-secret=yoursecret

# or with the CLI flag
./leafwiki --host 127.0.0.1 --jwt-secret=yoursecret
```

When bound to `127.0.0.1`, the server will only listen on localhost and won't be directly reachable from the public internet; the reverse proxy can forward requests from the external interface.
